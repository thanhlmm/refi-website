            - How can I filter documents by some criteria?<br />
            - How can I insert a new document from a JSON, in fact,  I have to write a script to insert some new documents<br />
            - I have to use GC Storage to backup the data, which I need to spend more time learning about. WTF ðŸ¤¬ why not just export and import by a JSON file?<br />
            - If I edit the same field of many documents, I need to go through documents and documents to edit.</>}
